{-| This is a placeholder for code that you will write later.

For example, if you are working with a large union type and have partially
completed a case expression, it may make sense to do this:

    type Entity = Ship | Fish | Captain | Seagull

    drawEntity entity =
      case entity of
        Ship ->
          ...

        Fish ->
          ...

        _ ->
          Debug.todo "handle Captain and Seagull"

The Elm compiler recognizes each `Debug.todo` so if you run into it, you get
an **uncatchable runtime exception** that includes the module name and line
number.

**Note:** This is not available with `elm make --optimize` or packages. The
idea is that a `todo` can be useful during development, but uncatchable runtime
exceptions should not appear in the resulting applications.

**Note:** For the equivalent of try/catch error handling in Elm, use modules
like [`Maybe`](#Maybe) and [`Result`](#Result) which guarantee that no error
goes unhandled!
